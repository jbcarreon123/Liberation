### What is Liberation?
Liberation is a Discord bot that creates temporary voice channels with a customizable control panel that allows you to configure a voice channel as if it were your own!
This can be useful if you're in a public server and you want to make a voice channel for you and your friends without having to worry about strangers or trolls joining and you won't be cluttering up your DMs with various group chats! 
Not to mention that group chats can only hold 10 people but this temporary voice channel solution holds a nearly limitless amount!
